# aztecproject_tabify
 This is my second year project, I made using Python. This is a desktop application which helps creates excel files out of pdf tables. 

A flowchart of the working of application is also given to understand it better. Ref: flowchart.png
Also, some examples of foo.pdf,foo2.pdf and rotated.pdf are shown for examples. You can get excel files of tables in the pdf easily.
You will have to run testfile.py (not setup.py) for running this application.

Note: PDF with no end of document is not supposed to work with this application.
Thank You!
